Object Detection using YOLO & OpenCV
Overview
This project implements real-time object detection using a pretrained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model with OpenCV in Python. It detects multiple objects in images and videos with high accuracy and speed.

Features
✅ Real-time object detection in images and videos
✅ Uses YOLO for efficient and accurate detection
✅ Displays bounding boxes with confidence scores
✅ Supports multiple object classes
✅ Works with both images and video streams
